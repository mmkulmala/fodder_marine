# fodder_marine
My Odin lang version of Cannon Fodder. This is still highly in-progress ;).

This is part of learning cool new programming language and a test how one creates games with the help of AI

## To build the game
Run following:
```bash
./build_fodder_marine.sh
```

## Run fodder_marine
Just to run the game:
```Odin
odin run fodder_marine.odin - file
```

## Other things
Checking is something wrong in Odin:
```Odin
odin check fodder_marine.odin -file
```

## AI stuff
I've used mostly Warp shell (or ADE) as a tool as well as Zed editor.

My ideas are then moved to prompt for AI agent and then I read the code in editor, just be sure that it should do what I intended it to do.
